<h1>Project for IMD 3901, Assignment 3</h1>

This experience is called "Heart vs Brain" where one user acts as the hearts and the other acts as the brain. It simulates the idea
of controlling emotions and not overreacting. The heart wants to react and is emotional, and the brain tries to rationalize the 
sitation. It also explores having different perspectives, allowing users to have different gameplays from each other. The heart 
room is a 2D view, while the brain view is 3D. Additionally, this allows for different device capabilities. The heart room is ideally
played on mobile or pc, and the brain room is ideally played on headset or pc. However, each room is capable of being played on each
device. 

The experience runs in scenario rounds where the users have 5 seconds per round to win. First, the players must press the generate
scenario button together to start. Once a random scenario is generated the round begins. The heart must try to get at a reaction 
active (they can only activate one reaction at a time when the time period runs out, while the brain attempts to neutralize the 
reactions and have no reactions active when the time period runs out. At the end of the time period, the winner is announced and 
the users can play again.
